# Flags :flags:

> _A collection of **SVG flags** available on Wikipedia_.

I often found myself re-visiting Wikipedia to download flags for different projects, a tedious and time-consuming task. On my vacation in 2018, I decided to make them all available - as they are - in a single repository, which became this repo.

For continents, I used the following links:

[Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa), America ([North](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America), [Central](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America), [South](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America)), [Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia), [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe) & [Oceania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceania).

As for the continental placement of countries in this repo, I did not visit these links in any particular order. I observed however that North and Central Americas, as well as Asia and Europe listed some countries in both lists. As I did not want to duplicate countries, some countries ended up listed in the continent I started with...

Out of a personal interest, I extended the collection to territories / regions / states of:

[Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2:BR) & [Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2:ES).

## Important note!

I _understand_ that flags are political in nature, but I have no political agenda. Bear in mind that:

* **This repository is a collection of flags _as they are available on Wikipedia_.**
* I have not modified any of the original content.
* I've made no effort in denoting colonial / common-wealth / political ownership over one country to / from another.
* Political disputes will never cease, so one can assume some flags might belong to disputed territories.
* Some historical flags are represented, even though they are no longer being officially used.
* Flags do change often, but I won't be making a conscious effort to keep this repository updated.
* I have no intention to entice conflict _with anyone_. **PEACE!** :sparkles:

Here's an overview of territories and their flags, some of them disputed, by [Wikipedia itself](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Dependent_territory_flags).

### Futher notes

#### On symbols

As I was already about to browse all those pages on Wikipedia, I decided to gather the symbols for each country as well.

They are often referred to as 'symbol', 'emblem', 'badge', 'seal', 'coat of arms', 'weapons', etc, but as they are mostly called **coat of arms** I decided to call all of them that way - for consistency - even though some of them are clearly not meant to be used that way.

#### On format and sizing

I limited this repo to **SVG**. All flags I seeked were available in `SVG`, but some 'coat of arms' were not. Many countries did not list or have those.

Flags were downloaded _"as they were"_, so I don't know if their sizing is accurate.
